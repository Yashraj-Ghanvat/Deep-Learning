🖼️ CIFAR-10 Image Classification using CNN
📌 Project Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 images across 10 different classes (airplane, car, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck).

The goal is to build a deep learning model that can accurately identify the category of an image.

📂 Dataset

Dataset: CIFAR-10

Size: 60,000 images (32x32 pixels, RGB)

Training set: 50,000 images

Test set: 10,000 images

Classes (10 total):

Airplane ✈️

Automobile 🚗

Bird 🐦

Cat 🐱

Deer 🦌

Dog 🐶

Frog 🐸

Horse 🐴

Ship 🚢

Truck 🚛

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 🐍

TensorFlow / Keras – Deep Learning framework

NumPy & Pandas – Data handling

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Visualization

🧠 Model Architecture

The CNN architecture used:

Conv2D + ReLU (for feature extraction)

Batch Normalization (for faster training & stability)

MaxPooling (for down-sampling)

Dropout (to prevent overfitting)

Dense + Softmax (for classification into 10 categories)

🚀 How to Run

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/cifar10-cnn.git
cd cifar10-cnn


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the training script:

python train.py


To test the model:

python evaluate.py

📊 Results

Training Accuracy: ~90%+ (depending on tuning)

Test Accuracy: ~80–85%

Model successfully distinguishes between CIFAR-10 classes with reasonable accuracy.

Example Confusion Matrix:

Class	Precision	Recall	F1-Score
Airplane	0.86	0.84	0.85
Automobile	0.89	0.88	0.88
Bird	0.78	0.75	0.76
...	...	...	...

🔮 Future Improvements

Use data augmentation for better generalization

Implement transfer learning (e.g., ResNet, VGG16, MobileNet)

Hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, batch size, optimizer)

Deploy model using Streamlit / Flask
